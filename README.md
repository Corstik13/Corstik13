- ⚡ Fun fact: ... "Spartans, Ready Your Breakfast And Eat Hardy, For Tonight We Dine In Hell!"  Leonidas
- 
- King Leonidas: Spartans! Prepare for glory!
- 
Daxos: Glory? Have you gone mad? There is no glory to be had now! Only retreat, or surrender or death!

King Leonidas: Well, that's an easy choice for us, Arcadian! Spartans never retreat! Spartans never surrender! Go spread the word. Let every Greek assembled know the truth of this. Let each among them search his own soul. And while you're at it, search your own.
